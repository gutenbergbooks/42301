<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As a wild maiden, with love-drinking eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sees in sweet dreams a beaming Youth of Glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wakes to weep, and ever after, sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that bright vision till her hair is hoary;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ev'n so, alas! is my life's-passion story.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Poesy my heart and pulses beat,<br /></span><span class="pagenum">[Pg 10]</span>
<span class="i0">For Poesy my blood runs red and fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Aaron's serpent the Egyptians' swallow'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One passion eats the rest. My soul is follow'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By strong ambition to out-roll a lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose melody will haunt the world for aye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charming it onward on its golden way.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">[<i>Tears the paper and paces the room with disordered steps.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, that my heart were quiet as a grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asleep in moonlight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as a torrid sunset boils with gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the zenith, fierce within my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A passion burns from basement to the cope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poesy! Poesy! I'd give to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As passionately, my rich-laden years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bubble pleasures, and my awful joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Hero gave her trembling sighs to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delicious death on wet Leander's lip.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare, bald, and tawdry, as a fingered moth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is my poor life, but with one smile thou canst<br /></span><span class="pagenum">[Pg 11]</span>
<span class="i0">Clothe me with kingdoms. Wilt thou smile on me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt bid me die for thee? O fair and cold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well may some wild maiden waste her love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the calm front of a marble Jove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot draw regard of thy great eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love thee, Poesy! Thou art a rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, a weak wave, would break on thee and die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a deadlier pang than that which beads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With chilly death-drops the o'er-tortured brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one has a big heart and feeble hands,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heart to hew his name out upon time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on a rock, then in immortalness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stand on time as on a pedestal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When hearts beat to this tune, and hands are weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We find our aspirations quenched in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears of impotence, and self-contempt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That loathsome weed, up-springing in the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like nightshade 'mong the ruins of a shrine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am so cursed, and wear within my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pang as fierce as Dives' drowsed with wine,<br /></span><span class="pagenum">[Pg 12]</span>
<span class="i0">Lipping his leman in luxurious dreams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waked by a fiend in hell!&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'T is not for me, ye Heavens! 't is not for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fling a Poem, like a comet, out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far-splendouring the sleepy realms of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot give men glimpses so divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when, upon a racking night, the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draws the pale curtains of the vapoury clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shows those wonderful, mysterious voids,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throbbing with stars like pulses.&mdash;Naught for me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to creep quietly into my grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or calm and tame the swelling of my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this foul lie, painted as sweet as truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That "great and small, weakness and strength, are naught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each thing being equal in its sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The May-night glow-worm with its emerald lamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is worthy as the mighty moon that drowns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continents in her white and silent light."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This&mdash;this were easy to believe, were I<br /></span><span class="pagenum">[Pg 13]</span>
<span class="i0">The planet that doth nightly wash the earth's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair sides with moonlight; not the shining worm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as I am&mdash;beaten, and foiled, and shamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arrow of my soul which I have shot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring down Fame, dissolved like shaft of mist&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This painted falsehood, this most damned lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freezes me like a fiendish human face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all its features gathered in a sneer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, let me rend this breathing tent of flesh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncoop the soul&mdash;fool, fool, 't were still the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'T is the deep soul that's touch'd, <i>it</i> bears the wound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And memory doth stick in 't like a knife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeping it wide for ever.<span style="margin-left: 5em;">[<i>A long pause.</i></span><br /></span>
<span class="i20">I am fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feed upon the beauty of the moon!<br /></span>
<span class="i26">[<i>Opens the casement.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrowful moon! seeming so drowned in woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A queen, whom some grand battle-day has left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unkingdomed and a widow, while the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy handmaidens, are standing back in awe,<br /></span><span class="pagenum">[Pg 14]</span>
<span class="i0">Gazing in silence on thy mighty grief!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All men have loved thee for thy beauty, moon!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adam has turned from Eve's fair face to thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drunk thy beauty with his serene eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anthony once, when seated with his queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worth all the East, a moment gazed at thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She struck him on the cheek with jealous hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chiding said,&mdash;"Now, by my Egypt's gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pale and squeamish beauty of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has had thine eyes too long; thine eyes are mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alack! there's sorrow in my Anthony's face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost think of Rome? I'll make thee, with a kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Richer than Cæsar! Come, I'll crown thy lips."<br /></span>
<span class="i26">[<i>Another pause.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How tenderly the moon doth fill the night!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not like the passion that doth fill my soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It burns within me like an Indian sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A star is trembling on the horizon's verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That star shall grow and broaden on the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until it hangs divine and beautiful<br /></span><span class="pagenum">[Pg 15]</span>
<span class="i0">In the proud zenith&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might I so broaden on the skies of fame!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Fame! Fame! Fame! next grandest word to God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seek the look of Fame! Poor fool&mdash;so tries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some lonely wanderer 'mong the desert sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By shouts to gain the notice of the Sphynx,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staring right on with calm eternal eyes.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like young Apollo, in his golden curls!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the oak-roots I've seen full many a flower,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unknown his childhood, save that he was born<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
<span class="i0">'Mong woodland waters full of silver breaks;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Green meadows golden in the level sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bright-haired child; and that, when these he left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell within a monstrous city's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees were gazing up into the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bare arms stretched in prayer for the snows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first we met, his book was six months old,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flowers from my barren sides. Oh! he was rich,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I rejoiced upon his shore of pearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A weak enamoured sea. Once did he say,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To speak his doom, so shall this Poet-king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call up the dead Past from its awful grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell him of our future. As the air<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Reflects the flower, tree, rook, and bending heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall he reflect our great humanity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the young Spring breathes with living breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a dead branch, till it sprouts fragrantly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green leaves and sunny flowers, shall he breathe life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through every theme he touch, making all Beauty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Poetry for ever like the stars."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His words set me on fire; I cried aloud,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He grasped my hand,&mdash;I looked upon his face,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Won a rich kingdom on a battle-day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the sunset he was ebbing fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ringed by his weeping lords. His left hand held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His white steed, to the belly splashed with blood,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His right, his broken brand; and in his ear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Again to meet her in the windy woods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When last we met she was as marble, calm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, with thick-beating heart and sight grown dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaping pulses and loud-ringing ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell-tale blood that rushed into my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blabbed the love secreted in my heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She must have understood that crimson speech,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And yet she frowned not. No, she never frowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think that I am worthy to be loved.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As an old mountain lifts its martyr's cairn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the pure sight of the holy heavens!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Waving in green, as the young breezes blow<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A lovely youth, in manhood's very edge,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tall and blue-eyed, and bright in golden hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With half-shut dreamy eyes, sweet earnest eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seemed unoccupied with outward things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeding on something richer! Strangely, oft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wildered smile lay on his noble lips.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunburnt shepherds stared with awful eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he went past; and timid girls upstole,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And on his cataract of golden curls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lonely grew, and went into the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think sweet thoughts, and marvel why they shook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heart-beat and with tremor when he came,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But there was one among that soft-voiced band<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who pined away for love of his sweet eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died among the roses of the spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Eve sat in the dew with closèd lids,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came gentle maidens bearing forest flowers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strew upon her green and quiet grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They soothed the dead with love-songs low and sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Songs sung of old beneath the purple night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Songs heard on earth with heart-beat and a blush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Songs heard in heaven by the breathless stars.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thought-wrapt, he wandered in the breezy woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the Summer, like a hermit, dwelt.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Up-bubbling 'mid a world of greenery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut-eyed, and dreaming of the fairest shapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That roam the woods; and when the autumn nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were dark and moonless, to the level sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would betake him, there to hear, o'er-awed,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One day he lay within the pleasant woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On bed of flowers edging a fountain's brim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazed into its heart as if to count<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veined and lucid pebbles one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up-shining richly through the crystal clear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus lay he many hours, when, lo! he heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maiden singing in the woods alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sad and tender island melody,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made a golden conquest of his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bringing a sadness sweeter than delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As nightingale, embowered in vernal leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pants out her gladness the luxurious night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon and stars all hanging on her song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She poured her soul in music. When she ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The charmèd woods and breezes silent stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if all ear to catch her voice again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uprose the dreamer from his couch of flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With awful expectation in his look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happy tears upon his pallid face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eager steps, as if toward a heaven,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He onward went, and, lo! he saw her stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fairer than Dian, in the forest glade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His footsteps startled her, and quick she turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face,&mdash;looks met like swords. He clasped his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell upon his knees; the while there broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sudden splendour o'er his yearning face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a pale prayer in its very self.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I know thee, lovely maiden!" then he cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I know thee, and of thee I have been told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been told by all the roses of the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By hermit streams, by pale sea-setting stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the roaring of the storm-tost pines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have sought for thee upon the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dim sweet dreams, on the complacent sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When breathless midnight, with her thousand hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beats to the same love-tune as my own heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've waited for thee many seasons through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen many autumns shed their yellow leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the oak-roots, heard many winters moan<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Through the leafless forests drearily.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now am I joyful, as storm-battered dove<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">'Tis that loveliest stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've learned by heart its sweet and devious course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By frequent tracing, as a lover learns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The features of his best-beloved's face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In memory it runs, a shining thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sunsets strung upon it thick, like pearls.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From yonder trees I've seen the western sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All washed with fire, while, in the midst, the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat like a pulse, welling at ev'ry beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spreading wave of light. Where yonder church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands up to heaven, as if to intercede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For sinful hamlets scattered at its feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the dreariest sight. The sun was down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the west was paved with sullen fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cried, "Behold! the barren beach of hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At ebb of tide." The ghost of one bright hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes from its grave and stands before me now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas at the close of a long summer day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we were sitting on yon grassy slope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunset hung before us like a dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shakes a demon in his fiery lair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds were standing round the setting sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like gaping caves, fantastic pinnacles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Citadels throbbing in their own fierce light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall spires that came and went like spires of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cliffs quivering with fire-snow, and peaks<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of pilèd gorgeousness, and rocks of fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-tilt and poised, bare beaches, crimson seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these were huddled in that dreadful west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All shook and trembled in unsteadfast light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the centre blazed the angry sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stern as the unlashed eye of God a-glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er evening city with its boom of sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I do remember, as we journeyed home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(That dreadful sunset burnt into our brains),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what a soothing came the naked moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, like a swimmer who has found his ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came rippling up a silver strand of cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plunged from the other side into the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I and that friend, the feeder of my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did wander up and down these banks for years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Talking of blessed hopes and holy faiths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sin and weeping all should pass away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the calm sunshine of the earth's old age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breezes are blowing in old Chaucer's verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas here we drank them. Here for hours we hung<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the fine pants and trembles of a line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft, standing on a hill's green head, we felt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breezes of love, and joy, and melody,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blow through us, as the winds blow through the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft with our souls in our eyes all day we fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On summer landscapes, silver-veined with streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er which the air hung silent in its joy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a great city lying in its smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monster sleeping in its own thick breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surgy plains of wheat, and ancient woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the calm evenings cawed by clouds of rooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acres of moss, and long black strips of firs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet cots dropt in green, where children played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To us unheard, till, gradual, all was lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In distance-haze to a blue rim of hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon whose heads came down the closing sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the crescent moon on autumn nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We paced its banks with overflowing hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discoursing long of great thought-wealthy souls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with what spendthrift hands they scatter wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their spirit-wealth, making mankind their debtors:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Affluent spirits, dropt from the teeming stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who come before their time, are starved, and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like swallows that arrive before the summer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or haply talked of dearer personal themes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind guesses at each other's after fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeling our leaping hearts, we marvelled oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they should be unleashed, and have free course<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stretch and strain far down the coming time&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in our guesses never was the <i>grave</i>.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is open on the soft and bending blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just where she lost her lover in the morn.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And smiles upon her, and some happy hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She holds his image in her crystal heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside that well I read the mighty Bard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who clad himself with beauty, genius, wealth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He sent a song into her haughty ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plead for him;&mdash;she listened, still he sang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tears, drawn by music, were upon her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till on its trembling close, to which she clung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like dying wretch to life, with a low cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She flung her arms around him, told her love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how she long had loved him, but had kept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It in her heart, like one who has a gem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hoards it up in some most secret place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While he who owns it seeks it and with tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won by the sweet omnipotence of song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave her lands! she paid him with herself.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On balcony, all summer roofed with vines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lady half-reclined amid the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Golden and green, soft-showering through the leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent she sat one-half the silent noon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last she sank luxurious in her couch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purple and golden-fringèd, like the sun's,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stretched her white arms on the warmèd air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To ease the empty aching of her heart.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lady said, "soothing myself to sleep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Oh, I could love, methinks, with all my soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I see nought to love; nought save some score<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lisping, curl'd gallants, with words i' their mouths<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Heavened in blooms that overclad the walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cool wind waved in upon his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stirred his curls. Soft fell the summer night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he arose, and with inspired lips said,&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of rich cathedral when the organ rolls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the answering choirs awake at once.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she sat down and thought upon her love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed on the various wonders of his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make his absence rich. "'Tis but three days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he went from me in his light canoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the world went with him, and to-night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will be back again. Oh, when he comes,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And when my head is laid upon his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the pauses of the sweetest storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of kisses that e'er beat upon a face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll tell him how I've pined, and sighed, and wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought of those sweet days and nights that flew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er us unheeded as a string of swans,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wavers down the sky toward the sea,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he will chide me into blissful tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then kiss the tears away." Quick leapt she up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He comes! he comes!" She laughed, and clapt her hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light canoe came dancing o'er the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he within it gave a cry of joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sent an answer back that drew him on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The swans are scared,&mdash;the lilies rippled&mdash;now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her happy face is hidden in his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And words are lost in joy. "My Bertha! let<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me see myself again in those dear orbs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you been lonely, love?" She raised her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You surely will not leave me so again!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I'll grow as pale 's the moon, and my praised cheeks<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As when the moon hath sleeked the blissful sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light wind wrinkles it and passes off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ran a transient trouble o'er his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My Bertha! we must leave this isle to-night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy shining face is blanked! We will return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere thrice the day, like a great bird of light<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"I stood afar upon the grassy hills,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I saw the basking ocean skinned with light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the surf upon the distant sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent and white as snow. Above my head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lark was singing, 'neath a sunny cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the playing winds. As I went down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There seemed a special wonder on the shore,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Low murmuring crowds around a temple stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a wildered music on the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which came and went, yet ever nearer grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, lo! a train came upward from the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With snowy garments, and with reverend steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in their front a silver cross they bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this sweet hymn they strewed along the winds.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Blest be this sunny morning, sweet and fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blest be the people of this pleasant land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye unseen larks that sing a mile in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye waving forests, waving green and grand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye waves, that dance upon the flashing strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye children golden-haired! we bring, we bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gospel hallowing.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then one stood forth and spoke against the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He called them 'cruel gods,' and then he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'We have a Father, One who dwells serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Bove thunder and the stars, Whose eye is mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever open as the summer sky;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Who cares for everything on earth alike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hears the plovers crying in the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The happy linnets singing in the broom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose smile is sunshine.' When the old man ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the murmuring crowd there stepped a youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As bright-haired as a star, and cried aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Friends! I've grown up among the wilds, and found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each outward form is but a window whence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terror or Beauty looks. Beauty I've seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sweet eyes of flowers, along the streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the cold and crystal wells that sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far in the murmur of the summer woods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terror in fire and thunder, in the worn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haggard faces of the winter clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shuddering winds, and oft on moonless nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've heard it in the white and wailing fringe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That runs along the coast from end to end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountains brooded on some wondrous thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which they would ne'er reveal. I seemed to stand<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Outside of all things; my desire to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew wild and eager as a starving wolf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gain the secret of the awful world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knelt before the gods, and then held up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart to them in the pure arms of prayer&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gave no answer, or had none to give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friends! I will test these sour and sullen gods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they are weak, 'tis well, we then may list<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the strangers; but if my affront<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw angry fire, I shall be slain by gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death may have no secrets. A spear! a steed!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A steed was brought by trembling hands, he sprang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dashed towards the temple with a cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shudder ran through all the pallid crowds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw him enter, and my sight grew dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on a long-suspended breath I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till one might count a hundred beats of heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he rode slowly forth, and, wondrous strange!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although an awful gleam lay on his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His charger's limbs were drenched with terror-sweat.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the anxious silence loud he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Gods, marvellously meek! Why, any child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May pluck them by the beard, spit in their face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or smite them on the mouth; they can do nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sit like poor old foolish men, and moan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I flung my spear.'&mdash;Here, as a singing rill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is in the mighty noise of ocean drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice was swallowed in the shout that rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And touched the heavens, ran along the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence came on after silence, strange and dim.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A voice rose 'mong the strangers like a lark,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the old man that spoke before went on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, oh! the gentle music of his voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stirred through my heart-strings like a wind through reeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, 'It was God's hand that shaped the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid it in the sunbeams:' and that 'God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With His great presence fills the universe.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That, could we dwell like night among the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or plunge with whales in the unsounded sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He still would be around us with His care.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And also, 'That, as flowers come back in Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We would live after Death.' I heard no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought of thee in this delightful isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure as a prayer, and wished that I had wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell you swiftly, that the death we feared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was but a grey eve 'tween two shining days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we would love for ever! Then I thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our home might be in that transparent star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which we have often watched from off this verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand in the dying sunset, large and clear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The humming world awoke me from my dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the old gods tumbled on the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like uncouth stones, they threw the temple wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Summer, with her bright and happy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked in upon its gloom, and pensive grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The while among the tumult of the crowds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divinest hymns the white-robed strangers sang.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I wearied for thee, Bertha! and I came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt go and hear these strangers?" She turned on him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A look of love&mdash;a look that richly crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment heavenly rich, and murmured "Yes."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kissed her proudly, while a giddy tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild with its happiness, ran down her cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perished in the dew. They took their seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as the paddles struck, grey-pinioned Time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew through the gates of sunset into Night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And held through stars to gain the coasts of Morn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis done! The phantoms of my soul have fled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which from my brooding eye takes strangest shapes.<br /></span>
